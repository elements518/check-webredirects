This Script was created for fellow admins, that work with apache servers and want to check there redirect files for problems.
Ofcourse this can work with any redirect file you provide it with, as long as the syntax is the same:
/path/to/site      /path/to/other/site

Fell free to leave some feedback and suggestions
